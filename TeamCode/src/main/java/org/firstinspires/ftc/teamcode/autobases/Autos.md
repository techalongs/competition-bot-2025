# Techalongs Autonomous Bases

This package contains base autos designed to move the robot off the LAUNCH line and gain LEAVE points. We intend for these to be shared at competition to teams who may want them. We have multiple files for different drivetrains and circumstances.

All files in this package are intended to move the robot forward until it is on the next game tile.

## Files
- Mecanum Drivetrain: `MecanumAuto.java`
- Tank Drivetrain: `TankAuto.java`

## Mecanum Drivetrain
- **File**: `MecanumAuto.java`
- **Bot**: 4-motor mecanum drivetrain
- Recommended starting position: Far LAUNCH line, with the back of the robot facing the audience
- Notes: No encoders are needed for this auto (time-based)

## Tank Drivetrain
- **File**: `TankAuto.java`
- **Bot**: 2-motor tank drivetrain
- Recommended starting position: Far LAUNCH line, with the back of the robot facing the audience
